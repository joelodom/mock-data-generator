On examination, mild clubbing of the fingertips is noted along with systolic ejection murmur at the second intercostal space. ECG reveals evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient's syncope is likely secondary to underlying aortic stenosis and left ventricular dysfunction. Further workup with echocardiogram and stress test is recommended for definitive diagnosis and management planning. Discharge instructions given for symptom monitoring and follow-up with cardiology.

Patient is a 55-year-old female presenting with a one-week history of dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema. Patient denies chest pain, cough, or fevers. Patient's physical exam revealed decreased breath sounds at the lung bases and bilateral 2+ pitting edema. Lab workup showed elevated BNP levels and a chest X-ray revealing cardiomegaly. Patient is scheduled for an echocardiogram to evaluate for possible systolic dysfunction. Plan includes diuresis with furosemide, monitoring vital signs, and dietary salt restriction. Follow-up visit scheduled in two weeks for reassessment of symptoms and response to treatment.

Patient is a 45-year-old female who presents with a one-week history of substernal chest pain, described as dull and intermittent, exacerbated by exertion and relieved by rest. Cardiac enzymes and EKG were within normal limits. On physical exam, no significant findings were noted. Given the patient's low risk for cardiac events, ruling out non-cardiac etiologies such as gastroesophageal reflux and musculoskeletal causes is warranted. Plan is to order an upper endoscopy to evaluate for possible esophageal pathology and recommend dietary modifications to reduce symptom severity. Follow-up scheduled in two weeks for further evaluation and consideration of stress testing if symptoms persist.
